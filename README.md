To run train the model the for Q3 prediction the molecule.py needs to be run. The resulted model is very big and can not be uploaded to git. But the resulte prints  are in sst3results.out

To run train the model the for Q8 prediction the moleculeSS8.py needs to be run. The resulted model is very big and can not be uploaded to git. The results prints are in ss8results.out

To test the models, run test.py 
The resulted prints for testing on CASP dataset is in CASPss3.out and CASPSS8.out
For feature extraction,
