To run train the model the for Q3 prediction the molecule.py needs to be run. The resulted model is very big and can not be uploaded to git.

To run train the model the for Q8 prediction the moleculeSS8.py needs to be run. The resulted model is very big and can not be uploaded to git.

To test the models, run test.py 

For feature extraction,
